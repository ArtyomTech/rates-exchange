# Rates Exchange FE App

This is a React application that requires Node.js and npm (or Yarn) to run. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the app locally.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

You can check if you have Node.js and npm installed by running the following commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### Breakdown:
1. **Prerequisites**: Details what tools and versions are needed (Node.js and npm).
2. **Installation**: Specifies the `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` command to handle any dependency conflicts during installation.
3. After installation, use `npm start` to start the React development server. This will open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

This should provide clear instructions for setting up and running the app locally.
